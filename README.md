# A Note on Versions and Compatibility

This course is heavily dependent on open and closed source software, across a wide swath of technologies and platforms.  These software components are constantly being developed, modified, and improved, invariably leading to compatibility issues.  So, when there are known compatibility issues, they will be called out in the courseware like so:


Any/all of these compatibility notes should be considered temporary - a future version of a component might improve or break the system.  The goal with these notes is to document the known compatibility issues as of the time of the last edit of the Courseware.
